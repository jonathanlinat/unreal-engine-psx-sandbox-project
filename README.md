# Unreal Engine PSX (PlayStation) Sandbox Project

This repository serves as a **development log** (**devlog**) and project storage space for creating a retro-style sandbox game inspired by the **PlayStation** (**PSX**) aesthetic, built using **Unreal Engine 5**.

Here, I document everything I've learned about the technical features and limitations of the **PlayStation** (**PSX**), as well as how to recreate them within **Unreal Engine 5**, with the ultimate goal of building a functional retro-style game.
