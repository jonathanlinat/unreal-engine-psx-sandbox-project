# Unreal Engine PSX (PlayStation) Sandbox Project

This repository functions as a development log (devlog) and project workspace for creating a retro-style sandbox game inspired by the **PlayStation** (**PSX**) aesthetic, developed using **Unreal Engine 5**.

I document everything Iâ€™ve learned about the technical features and limitations of the game console hardware and explore how to replicate them in the game engine. The ultimate goal is to create a fully functional retro-style game that captures the charm of the game console era.
