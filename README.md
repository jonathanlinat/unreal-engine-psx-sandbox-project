# Unreal Engine PSX (PlayStation) Sandbox Project

This repository functions as a development log (devlog) and project workspace for creating a retro-style sandbox game inspired by the **PlayStation** (**PSX**) aesthetic, developed using **Unreal Engine 5** and other free tools.

I document everything I am learning about the technical features and limitations of the game console hardware, as well as 90s game mechanics, and focus on replicating them within the game engine. The ultimate goal is to create a fully functional retro-style game that captures the essence of the game console era.
